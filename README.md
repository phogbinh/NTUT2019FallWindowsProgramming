# Windows Programming
## Description
This is the homework repository for the course *Windows Programming* opened during the 2019 Fall Semester at the National Taipei University of Technology.
## Homework Projects
The homework comprises of two projects:
* Order and Storage Management System
* Dual Views Drawing Application

The project *Order and Storage Management System* was mostly written and committed in this repository before having been transferred to the repository [OrderAndStorageManagementSystem](https://github.com/phogbinh/OrderAndStorageManagementSystem). On the other hand, the later project is done entirely on the repository [DualViewsDrawingApplication](https://github.com/phogbinh/DualViewsDrawingApplication).
